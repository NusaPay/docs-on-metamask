# Problem

Despite an increasingly connected world, international money transfers still face significant hurdles. NusaPay is specifically designed to address these inherent challenges, which arise from reliance on outdated systems and the complexity of integrating digital assets with local fiat currencies.

### Fragmented Liquidity and Limited Transfer Pathways

**Traditional remittance systems often operate within isolated corridors with fragmented liquidity**, limiting user options and forcing them to use different platforms for different purposes. In the Web3 context, similar challenges arise when assets are fragmented across various chains, making value transfers complicated and expensive, ultimately hindering capital efficiency and users' ability to access optimal exchange rates or the best transfer routes. NusaPay addresses this by **facilitating seamless cross-country and cross-currency liquidity access**, enabling the direct conversion of USDC from various blockchains (which can be accessed through a MetaMask interface) to specific local currencies and direct deposits into local bank accounts, empowering users to navigate these financial ecosystems without these barriers.

### Slow & Costly Conversion, "Burning," and Payout Processes

**Traditional cross-border fund transfer mechanisms and even some early crypto-to-fiat solutions often involve numerous intermediaries, lengthy confirmation processes, and hidden fees**. Stages such as currency conversion, bank clearing processes, and final deposits can take days, leading to significant inefficiencies and high operational costs. **NusaPay mitigates this through optimized and automated smart contract execution**, where the entire transaction cycle is executed **efficiently and transparently,** ensuring rapid and secure confirmation.

### Security Risks and Reliance on Centralized Intermediaries

**Sending money internationally through traditional banks or remittance services involves significant reliance on centralized intermediaries,** which can become single points of failure or targets for cyber-attacks, and contradicts the ethos of Web3 decentralization. **NusaPay implements a trustless execution model entirely governed by audited smart contracts**, where all protocol functions are executed transparently and verified on-chain. This ensures that all cross-border operations are secure, censorship-resistant, and eliminate the need for vulnerable centralized intermediaries, empowering users with full sovereignty over their funds through direct interaction with their Web3 wallet.

### Lack of Transparency and Cross-Ecosystem Transaction Tracking Capabilities

In older remittance systems, users often face difficulty tracking their transaction status in real-time or accessing comprehensive transfer histories, especially when funds move between blockchains and fiat systems, leading to uncertainty and a lack of control over their money. **NusaPay addresses this by providing detailed and comprehensive transaction histories for all payments that can be tracked on-chain**, allowing users to accurately monitor payment status from the initial crypto transfer to confirmation of deposit in the local bank, ensuring full transparency and better control over the cross-border payment experience.

### Limited Adoption & Integration of Digital Cross-Border Payment Solutions

Despite the emergence of digital assets, the integration of blockchain-based payment solutions into the global financial ecosystem still faces adoption challenges. Many users remain hesitant or lack easy tools to convert digital assets to local fiat currency directly and efficiently into their bank accounts, especially if this means interacting with many different interfaces. **NusaPay is designed to overcome these adoption barriers by offering an intuitive user interface and a seamless experience**, fostering long-term utility and adoption by providing an easily accessible and composable bridge between digital assets and traditional banking systems.
