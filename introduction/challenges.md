# Challenges

Building and operating an innovative cross-border payment protocol like NusaPay involves a series of complex technical and operational challenges. Overcoming these challenges is crucial to ensuring scalability, security, and widespread adoption, especially in the context of the MetaMask Hackathon that drives Web3 innovation.

### Complexity of Cross-System Integration: Blockchain, Wallet, & Traditional

**Developing NusaPay requires seamless interoperability between smart contracts on various blockchains** (to receive multichain USDC) **and traditional banking systems** (for fiat payouts). This challenge is compounded by the need to provide a smooth user experience through wallets like MetaMask, which serve as the user's primary interface to Web3. This includes building secure and efficient bridges between the crypto and fiat worlds, managing fiat gateways, and ensuring that MetaMask interactions remain intuitive.

### Liquidity Management & Cross-Chain Conversion Optimization

Ensuring sufficient liquidity for USDC swaps into local currencies across various corridors is a major challenge. NusaPay must dynamically manage on-chain and off-chain liquidity pools, optimize exchange routes to minimize slippage and costs, and ensure the availability of fiat funds in recipient bank accounts. This also includes mitigating exchange rate volatility during the conversion process and providing transparent pricing to users who initiate their transactions from MetaMask.

### Smart Contract & Fiat Gateway Security Risks

Operating at the intersection of digital assets and fiat systems introduces dual security risks. NusaPay's smart contracts must be resilient to attacks and exploits, while fiat gateways (partnerships with financial institutions) must be secure from fraud and data breaches. Ensuring rigorous security audits for smart contracts, implementing best security practices for sensitive data, and real-time activity monitoring are crucial to protecting user funds flowing through MetaMask to fiat systems.

### User Adoption & Web3 Market Education

Although NusaPay offers a superior solution, user adoption challenges persist, especially in markets dominated by traditional systems and for users who might be new to Web3. Educating users about the security and efficiency benefits of blockchain-based payments, building trust, and providing a seamless onboarding experience are key. This includes simplifying technical interactions and providing comprehensive support, making the transition from Web2 to Web3 as smooth as possible for payment use cases.
