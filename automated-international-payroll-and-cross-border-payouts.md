# Automated International Payroll & Cross-border Payouts

NusaPay not only facilitates individual fund transfers but is also designed to automate large-scale payout processes such as international payroll and cross-border disbursements for businesses. With a focus on an intuitive user experience, data reusability, and seamless integration with MetaMask, we simplify what was once a manual and time-consuming process.

1. Simple User Flow & MetaMask Integration: Easy Wallet Connection: Users easily connect their crypto wallet, such as MetaMask, to the NusaPay interface. This is a crucial first step to initiate all transactions. Recipient Profile Management: Users can create and manage "instances" or profiles for each recipient. This includes essential details such as bank account numbers and account holder names. Creating Payout Indications: For each recipient, a payout indication in the local currency (e.g., IDRX) is created, linking the bank account details to a specific payment purpose.
2. Efficient Payout Execution: Select Recipient: Once recipient profiles are set up, users can easily select a recipient from their saved list. Enter Amount: The amount of funds to be disbursed is entered, and the system automatically calculates the conversion to the local currency. Confirm Transaction with MetaMask: Users review details and confirm the transaction via their MetaMask wallet, including approving the token and digitally signing to authorize the payment.
3. Automation & Data Reusability for Scalability: Recipient Data Storage: NusaPay intelligently stores recipient details (name, bank account, etc.) from each transaction input in a secure database. This eliminates the need to re-enter the same information for future payments, ideal for recurring payroll. Comprehensive Transaction History: All transactions are recorded in a detailed and accessible history, allowing users to track payment status in real-time and access historical records at any time. Each transaction also has an on-chain transaction hash for full transparency. Schedule & Reuse Payments: With saved recipient data, users can quickly "make payments" repeatedly by simply calling up the recipient's name. This significantly reduces the administrative burden for international payroll or mass payouts, making NusaPay an ideal solution for modern businesses.
4. Remittances for Key Markets: Remittances to Indonesia: The process includes: Connect MetaMask Wallet, Approve Transaction, Sign, Swap then Get IDRX, Redeem IDRX, and Funds deposited into Bank Account. Remittances to Brazil: A similar flow, where tokens are swapped and then in the front-end interface, the amount is displayed in Brazilian Real (BRL) for user convenience, entirely orchestrated via NusaPay's smart contracts.
